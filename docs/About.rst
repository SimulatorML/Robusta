Welcome to the project, which was created by the students of the "ML Simulator" course under the guidance of **Bogdan Gromov**!
The task consisted of a complete refactoring of the project, from rewriting the structure to writing tests, annotations and docstring.

The following work was carried out within the framework of the project:
 - Rewritten project structure for better readability and modularity.
 - Tests have been written for each module of the project to ensure the correctness of its work.
 - Type annotations have been added to the code to improve its readability and improve the IDE.
 - Added docstring for each module and function to make the code easier to understand and use.
 
After the refactoring, the project became more readable, understandable and modular. Tests ensure that the code works correctly, 
and type and docstring annotations make it easier to understand and use the project.

The student team is grateful to **Bogdan Gromov** for his support and assistance in the implementation of the project.
